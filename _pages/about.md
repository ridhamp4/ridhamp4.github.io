Hi! I am Ridham. I am from Gandhinagar & brought up in Ahmedabad. I am currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science at IIT Gandhinagar. 

Starting since I was in school, I used to love coding without knowing how to pursue it. Thought IITs were the best platform to learn CS or coding (Expectations maybe far from reality) and I somehow ended up here. Explored app & web development at the very beginning, invested a decent amount of time building a very useful SaaS for Civil Engineers called Retice BBS from my dad's inspiration (primarily built for his organisation's personal use cases). Tried commercialising it, got a few hundred clients. But, as we moved forward, things started getting clear and I decided to pivot myself towards DeepTech!

I found ML interesting starting from my sophomore year, explored Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science too, through formal or informal channels, along with some projects in those domains. As time moved on, opportunities unfurled. Currently working on an ambitious Generative-AI enhanced PCB Designing Software tool under Prof. S.R. Sarangi at IIT Delhi. Coincidentally, I am also stuck in a very specific domain of Graph Machine Learning (Very recent and interesting) and actively exploring research areas in the domain. I don't know, but knowingly or unknowingly, I end up at Graph Machine Learning, and therefore, I no longer consider it a coincidence.

In addition to the research, projects, and academics, I have also been eager and actively working to improve student life in general at IIT Gandhinagar just for the good will. As of now, I am the Senator for BTech'23 (my batch), where I along with 3 more represent our batch at administrative levels. I am also the Management Coordinator at the Technical Council of IIT Gandhinagar, where our responsibility is to improve the techincal culture of the college, push and motivate students to find and pursue techincal domains of their interests.

There's a lot to talk about, but that was the brief introduction of mine. Please feel free to reach out to me for anything I could help you with, am always eager to do so!

See you until next time!
